Group 2/10 Problem â€“ Software Sales

A software company sells a package that retails for $99. Quantity discounts are given according to the following table:

Quantity Discount

10-19 20%

20-49 30%

50-99 40%

100 or more 50%

Create an application that lets the user enter the number of packages purchased. The program should then display the amount of the discount (if any) and the total amount of the purchase after the discount.
